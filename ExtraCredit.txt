Implement a run-time option to choose the group specific port from the
command line, for example, tftpserver -p 7000. If the option is passed to the
server, it specifies the port to listen to, while if it is passed to the client, it
specifies the port to which the initial request must be sent to. This makes
your programs inter operable with standards compliant implementations that
use “well-known” UDP port # 69. If the option is not present, your programs
must use your assigned port # as the default.
